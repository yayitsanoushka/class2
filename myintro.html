        <br>
        <h3>my name is <i>anoushka</i></h3>
        <br>
        <h4>i am 13 years old</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>here are some things about me</h4>
        <p>I like a lot of different<em>places, music, etc.</em> First, let's start with the places I like going to. I quite like going to <b>the beach</b> because I like snorkelling, sea swimming, and I hope I get the chance to go diving in the sea. I also like going to well-doing <b>cities during the night</b> because all of the skyscrapers are <mark>very beautifully lit up.</mark> Now, let's move on to the music that I like. There are <mark>3 main bands that I quite enjoy at the moment.</mark> The first one is <em>Arctic Monkeys.</em> I enjoy them because I find their songs easy to relate to, and I really enjoy the vocals and the melody. The second one is <b>Wave to Earth.</b> I really like their music because the instrumental makes me feel a strange feeling of serenity, along with their vibe as a whole. And lastly, I like <b>Laufey.</b>I like her because her music is also easy to relate to, with them having a similar thematic and feeling.</p>
